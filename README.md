Now you can take care of your own digital pet!

Your pet has 3 parameters: hunger level, mood level, and health level. (and a secret one is age)
To feed or to make your pet happier just click on the stats

If you won't keep an eye on mood level the pet can get sick, and you will need to buy pills to get it treated.
Sometimes the pet can make a poop, so it is better to clean up asap (to do it just click on the poop), otherwise your pet will loose his health points.

There is a shop, where you are able to make some purchases (Every game year you will get 1 coin).
So, you can buy litter box, and you won't need to clean after your pet, because it will do poop in that litter box.
The same story with toys - the mood level will never decrease.

Try to click on the pet, there is something cute :3
